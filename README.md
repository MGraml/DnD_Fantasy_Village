# Economy-simulation for a high-fantasy village #

The idea of this webpage was to create a simple way to handle the logistics of a medieval village with a bunch of buildings and diplomatic relations, i.e. trade agreements. You can exemplarily load the reference json inside the repository to take a look onto all the functionalities.

By clicking the moon-button on the webpage, you find the manual with a short description of the different features.

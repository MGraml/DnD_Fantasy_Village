                <p>Welcome to Assignan's (or maybe another medieval/fantasy village's) economy simulator!</p>
                <p>At first, take some time and enjoy the hidden easter eggs on the page! Maybe you want to read a book? ;) 
                    But watch out when pressing the buttons, some indicate their output by a sound, which can be turned down 
                    by the button on the right in three stages (100%, 10% or 0% volume).</p>
                <p>As you can see, Assignan has a complex economy and this website will facilitate
                    the managing of all the resulting exhaustingly numerous difficulties.
                </p>
                <p>The most important part is the main screen where you potentially see a request
                    to load a .json file. In that case, switch to section <a href="#SaveLoad">3 Your own village - Save and Load</a></li>
                    to start. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, we have buttons in the right upper corner to adjust goods and buildings/sources of income,
                    the already mentioned Save/Load buttons in the left bottom corner and  below the two ‚áê,‚áí - buttons for switching 
                    between the statistics in the main screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At last, you obviously already found the "Manual"-moon to this page and after you have loaded your village, 
                    you can also use the "Week passed"-sun to progress in time and watch your village growing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All Buttons are also accessible via the following keys:
                    <ul>
                        <li>F1 - Triggers the manual.</li>
                        <li>ESC - Triggers the Settings button.</li>
                        <li>ENTER - Triggers the "Week passed" button.</li>
                        <li>&#8592; - Triggers the window change to the left.</li>
                        <li>&#8594; - Triggers the window change to the right.</li>
                        <li>CTRL+S - Saves the database.</li>
                        <li>CTRL+L - Load a .json-file with database.</li>
                        <li>‚Üì - Turns down the volume in the order of the button, i.e. the first click completely mutes everything and the second one sets the volume to a small fraction.</li>
                        <li>‚Üë - Turns down the volume against the order of the button, i.e. first smaller volume, then full mute.</li>
                        <li>CTRL+P - Toggles the Protocol window in-/visible.</li>
                        <li>CTRL+M - Toggles the Messenger window in-/visible.</li>
                        <li>CTRL+C - Toggles the list of contacts.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            <h2 id="MainScreen">The main screen - Statistics</h2>
            <p>That one is probably the most important one, which shows all your progress and gives you most of the opportunities 
                to interact with your village. It is split into three different windows:</p>
            <h3 id="StatsOverall">Overall statistics</h3>
            <p>In this window, you can find all the informations besides goods and sources of income. The icons have the following meanings:</p>
                <ul id="icons">
                    <li>&#127968; - Housings for the people</li>
                    <li>üë™ - total number of inhabitants</li>
                    <li>üßë - number of adults</li>
                    <li>üßí - number of children</li>
                    <li>‚òÜ - fame</li>
                    <li>üó≤ - arcane</li>
                    <li>&#129717; - resources besides food</li>
                    <li>&#127828; - food</li>
                    <li>&#129689; - Value in goldpieces</li>
                    <li>&#127970; - buildings besides housings</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Therefore, the left hand side shows the population and "diplomatic" values, whereas the right hand side 
                shows storage capacities and the value of the assets in Assignan.</p>
            <p>The number of people are rounded to integers, but in the background these values are handled as floats to imitate the growth of the villagers.
                If there are not enough houses for your people, the section will turn red to indicate a problem and cause debuffs to your production modifier (proportional to the rate of missing and existing housings).</p>
            <h3 id="StatsGoods">Statistics of possessed goods</h3>
            <p>Here, all goods are listed alphabetically with their current total number, 
                their income in the next week, the value per unit in goldpieces and their total value.
            </p>
            <p>In this stage of the code, there are penalties/caps implemented in case you have not enough food or try to store more goods than you have storage.</p>
            <p>The first case causes lower productivity (proportional to the importance of the specific kind of food) and at the threshold of 50% producivity, 
                the people start to riot and fewer new inhabitants will immigrate. On the other hand, if you provide luxury and other sources of happiness, 
                the productivity can exceed 100% and thus, the fame will be modified.
            </p>
            <p>
                By hovering about the box with the current production modifier, you can find all informations about buffs and debuffs on the current production modifier.
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides the general productivity, production can be go down because of missing products in the supply chain. This case is identified by orange income 
                and further information can be obtained by hovering above the income per week.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second case of exceeding hard caps of the storage or housings during the weekly income can cause trouble by filling the storehouse up to the maximum.
                Disregarding the source of the overflow, the storage will always be capped to the given capacity of the storehouses etc.
            </p>
            <h3 id="StatsBuildings">Statistics of buildings and sources of income</h3>
            <p>Using that window, you can manage your buildings, monitor their yields and adjust either the number of buildings by investing resources (Keep an eye on your resources: 
                If a red button, instead of a green one, appears when you are hovering about it, there will be nothing built. The number of missing goods can be identified by staying a bit longer with the mouse above the button.)
                or the number of other sources of income like for example new workers, which have joint the village in the last week, supporting the existing workers.</p>
            <h2 id="Settings">Adjusting the statistics - Settings</h2>
                <p>To account for dynamic situation, where Sir Thomas Nook of the East Ind Company
                    sends his best regards and, more important, a ship full of cargo, you can click the "Settings"-button (if 
                    a json is loaded).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, you are able to add goods or buildings/sources of income without messing with the json-file. These changes will then be saved and displayed in the protocol window
                    (which can be toggled in-/visible with the corresponding "Protocol" button) and further be sent along with the json file to your Discord server (cf. chapter <a href="#Messenger">6</a>).
                </p>
                <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Adding items</p>
                <p>Here, you can add or remove a number of existing items by writing a name, selecting one operation 
                    (Add or Remove) and typing your wanted number. In that case, the Value per Unit is not taken into account, since the item already exists.</p>
                <p>For a new item, whose name is not known, and therefore not suggested in the droplist, you have to remain with the Add option and also write a Value per Unit. There is also the possibility 
                    to add food and luxury food, which can be done by inserting a consumption and a luxury modifier. Hovering above the inputs shows some hints.</p>
                <p>Be advised: Adding a new food let the villagers acquire a taste for it and you have to provide also a source of income; otherwise the production modifier will go down. 
                    You can avoid that by introducing it as a luxury good.</p>
                <p>If you add too much items for the space, the input number will be replaced by a 0 and you will hear an error sound. 
                    A new item will nevertheless be added to the Goods (with a total number 0 of stored items in order to prevent typos from messing up the whole database). 
                    By hovering above an input, you can find some hints. If you remove more items of a kind than stored, you will remove everything instead of generating "negative" storage.</p>
                <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Adding new sources of income</p>
                <p>Moreover, you can use the settings to add NEW and UNBUILDABLE sources of income. If you want to add a new building, which can be built as described in 
                    section <a href="#StatsBuildings">2.3</a>, you have to deal with the json file by itself, 
                    as no new buildings were planned at the stage of writing this webside. 
                    Now, you can add a name, potential constant or weekly yields and whether the number of workers/sources should be variable or fixed. 
                    By clicking again the arrow button, the database will be updated and the source of income is shown in the table described by section
                    <a href="#StatsBuildings">2.3</a>.
                </p>
            <h2 id="SaveLoad">Your own village - Save, Load and Send</h2>
                <p>
                    If it is your first time visting that page (after clearing your browser's cache),
                    you have to load a database into the system. That one is saved in a json file as 
                    in the repository under "./src/data/reference_database.json". Click the load button,
                    select that (or any other suitable) file and you are ready to go!
                </p>
                <p>
                    After finishing a session, you probably want to save your progress to prevent 
                    dataloss through cache clearing. Just press the "Save"-button and download the 
                    current database as a json-file, which can be loaded every time you accidentally 
                    cleared the cache or you want to revert some changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By inserting the webhook of a Discord textchannel into the json or pasting it into the popping prompt, you can now also send the json-file
                    and possibly the protocol over the passed actions to your own Discord server!
                </p>
            <h2 id="Messenger">Messenger to your Discord server</h2>
                <p>
                    Introducing the tool for ingame communication between the officials of your village and the players: 
                    You can now use the webhook to Discord to implement letters from NPCs to your players via Discord! By clicking 
                    on the "Messenger" button, a window pops up to deliver this message (using the same webhook as for the json-file).
                </p>

                <p>Welcome to Assignan's (or maybe another medieval/fantasy village's) economy simulator!</p>
                <p>At first, take some time and enjoy the hidden easter eggs on the page! Maybe you want to read a book? ;)</p>
                <p>As you can see, Assignan has a complex economy and this website will facilitate
                    the managing of all the resulting exhaustingly numerous difficulties.
                </p>
                <p>The most important part is the main screen where you potentially see a request
                    to load a .json file. In that case, switch to section <a href="#SaveLoad">3 Your own village - Save and Load</a></li>
                    to start. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, we have buttons in the right upper corner to adjust goods and buildings/sources of income,
                    the already mentioned Save/Load buttons in the left bottom corner and  below the two <,> - buttons for switching 
                    between the statistics in the main screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At last, you obviously already found the "Manual"-moon to this page and after you have loaded your village, 
                    you can also use the "Week passed"-sun to progress in time and watch your village growing.
